I'm a computer science enthusiast with a passion for data-driven technologies and full-stack development. Currently, I'm on an academic adventure, pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NC State University, with a special focus on Data Science and Security.

My journey began as a Mercedes-Benz R&D Engineer, where I delved into Kafka technology, contributing to a Shared Event Streaming Platform. This experience ignited my passion for cutting-edge technologies.

What truly lights up my day is mentoring young undergraduates. I've had the privilege of helping a few talented individuals kickstart their careers, and there's no greater joy than seeing them soar.

I'm always up for a friendly chat, a collaboration on exciting projects, or exploring fresh opportunities in the tech world.

Cheers to innovation, learning, and all the wonderful connections along the way!ðŸ˜„
